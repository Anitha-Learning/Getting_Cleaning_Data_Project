Purpose : To prepare tidy data , that can be used for later analysis , using data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsumg Galaxy S smartphone.

Files include :
1. run_analysis.R - R script to merge, clean up and transform the data
2. run_analysis_output.txt - Output file generated by the R script (run_analysis.R)
3. CodeBook.md - Description and summary of the data collected and variables used and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
4. README.md - help file for the project
5. files downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Steps taken for getting and cleaning data :
1. Path of the working directory needs to be set for the  script to find the test/train files in the local directory.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	Example : in the data set, where the feature has a "t" prefix it was update to "time"
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Results :
Executing the R script results in the tidydata.txt file.
